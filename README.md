# 🏃‍♀️‍➡️ Run Smart

`Run Smart` is my first front-end project, created to explore and experiment with modern web development tools. This project marks my initial experience in integrating PHPMailer for email functionality and using Gulp for task automation.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provided the structure and content of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: Styled the website, with a focus on responsive design and modern layout techniques.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Added interactivity and dynamic content to enhance user experience.
- **Gulp**: Implemented for automating repetitive tasks like compiling, minifying CSS/JS, and live reloading during development.
- **Sass**: Used for writing modular and maintainable CSS with variables, mixins, and nesting.
- **PHPMailer**: Integrated for the first time to handle email sending through PHP.

## 🚀 Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with key web development tools and technologies. This project allowed me to:
- Experiment with Gulp for the first time to streamline the development workflow.
- Integrate PHPMailer to learn how to handle email functionality within a web project.

## 🌐 Live Demo

You can view the live version of the website here:

**Note:** The website may not fully function if hosted on GitHub Pages, as GitHub Pages does not support PHP or server-side technologies required for email functionality with PHPMailer.

## 💡 Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to work seamlessly on devices of all sizes.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes JavaScript-driven elements to enhance user engagement.
- **Email Integration**: PHPMailer is used to implement basic email sending functionality.
